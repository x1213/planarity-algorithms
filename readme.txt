# Format for graph representation:

We adapt the adjacency-list represntation here.
First line indicates the number of vertices.
All the index of vertices are within the range [1, N].
The rest lines represent the adjacency list of each vertex.
The '0' indicates the end of a line.

=====================
Example_1:
---------------------
K_5
---------------------
N=5
1: 2 3 4 5 0
2: 1 3 4 5 0
3: 1 2 4 5 0
4: 1 2 3 5 0
5: 1 2 3 4 0

---------------------
A maximal planar subgraph of K_5 output by our
maximal planar subgraph finder algorithm:
---------------------
N=5
1: 2 5 4 0
2: 3 1 5 4 0
3: 4 2 5 0
4: 5 3 2 1 0
5: 4 3 2 1 0

---------------------
By calling the planarity testing algorithm,
a conbinatorial embedding is identified as following:
---------------------
N=5
1: 4 2 5 0
2: 1 4 3 5 0
3: 2 4 5 0
4: 5 3 2 1 0
5: 1 2 3 4 0

# Format for the spec for random graph:

A random graph is determined by two parameters, namely N and P.
First number is an integer indicates |V(G)| = N.
Second number is a double indicates the probability of existence of each edge = P.

=====================
Example_2:
---------------------
A spec for a random graph with (N=15, P=0.3)
---------------------
15
0.3

---------------------
A sample resulting graph generated by our program:
---------------------
N=15
1: 2 4 12 0
2: 1 4 5 7 8 11 12 13 0
3: 7 11 0
4: 1 2 11 13 15 0
5: 2 12 13 15 0
6: 8 10 11 13 14 0
7: 2 3 12 0
8: 2 6 11 0
9: 12 13 0
10: 6 15 0
11: 2 3 4 6 8 14 0
12: 1 2 5 7 9 14 0
13: 2 4 5 6 9 14 0
14: 6 11 12 13 0
15: 4 5 10 0

---------------------
By calling the planarity testing algorithm,
since it is not a planar graph, 
a Kuratowski subgraph, which is homeomorphic to K_3,3,
is identified as following:
---------------------
N=15
1: 2 12 0
2: 1 4 13 0
3: 7 11 0
4: 2 11 13 0
5: 0
6: 0
7: 3 12 0
8: 0
9: 0
10: 0
11: 3 4 0
12: 1 7 14 0
13: 2 4 14 0
14: 12 13 0
15: 0
